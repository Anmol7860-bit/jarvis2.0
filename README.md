Jarvis – Voice Assistant

Jarvis is a simple Python-based voice assistant inspired by Alexa and Google Assistant. It can recognize voice commands, open websites, play music from a predefined library, and even connect with the OpenAI API for conversational responses.

✨ Features

🎤 Voice Activation: Wake Jarvis by saying "Jarvis".

🌐 Open Websites: Commands like "open Google", "open YouTube", "open Facebook", "open LinkedIn".

🎵 Play Music: Use "play [song]" to play from your musicliberary.

🤖 AI Integration: When Jarvis doesn’t recognize a command, it sends the query to the OpenAI API for a response.

🔊 Text-to-Speech: Jarvis replies with a natural-sounding voice using pyttsx3.

 🛠️ Requirements

Install the required libraries:
pip install speechrecognition pyttsx3 openai
musicliberary.py → A Python file containing a dictionary of songs and links

Microphone access for speech recognition.

Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

🚀 Usage

Run the script:
python jarvis.py

Then:

Say "Jarvis" to activate.

Speak a command (e.g., "open Google", "play believer", or ask a question).

Jarvis will respond with speech or perform the action.

You may need to install PyAudio for microphone support:
pip install pyaudio
